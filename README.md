# Neural Style Transfer

### Summary
Neural Style Transfer is process of incorporating the semantic content information
from one image and the style features of another image to create a hybrid image.
The goal of this project was to recreate Gatys *et al*.’s Neural Style Transfer algorithm using VGG-19 and test how images of different complexity for content and
style contributed to a hybrid image. Proper recreation of Gatys *et al*.’s was achieved
and it was found that ’freeform’ abstract style artworks led to less boundaries from
initial content images being kept. Using less abstract style art pieces created images
that were generally more aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, it was shown that
initialization image played a large role in the final output image. When initialized
with style or content images, more style or content would be apparent in the final
image. When initializing with random noise, the resulting hybrid image was less
comprehensible. These results provide insight into further areas to be explored in
the Neural Transfer Style space.
